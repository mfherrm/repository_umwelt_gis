<h1>Repository Umwelt GIS</h1>
<p>This repository was created by [Anton Dolgov](https://github.com/ToniGold) and [Marius Herrmann](https://github.com/mfherrm). It aims to visualise and teach students via a webtool using blended learning and gamification. All topics are related to sustainable developments for Kenya, Germany, and South Africa. In order to run this tool, hosting a local server, e.g. via VS Code is required. </p>
